In order to be entitled to retirement pay, an employee must have both rendered at the minimum years of service and reached the age of optional or compulsory retirement.

In the absence of a retirement plan or agreement for retirement benefits, optional retirement may be availed of by the age of 60 years or the employee may be retired upon reaching the compulsory age of retirement of 65 years. (Art. 302, Labor Code) 

An employee who satisfies both of these requirements is entitled to retirement pay.

In the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for the calculation of the retirement pay, a qualified employee shall be entitled to at least 1/2 month salary for every year of service. A fraction of at least 6 months shall be considered as 1 whole year for this purpose. (Art. 302, Labor Code)

Unless the parties provide for broader inclusions, 1/2 month salary shall mean 15 days plus 1/12 of the 13th month pay and the cash equivalent of not more than 5 days of service incentive leaves. (Art. 302, Labor Code) The ½ month salary is computed as being the total of 22.5 days, which is the result of adding 15 days plus 2.5 days representing 1/12 of the 13th month pay plus 5 days of service incentive leave.

For certain causes, the Labor Code requires that for a termination to be valid, two notices be given to the employee. He must first be notified in writing of the reason behind the termination and given adequate time to raise his defense. He must be heard after a reasonable period of at least 5 days to prepare. After the hearing, he must again be notified in writing that he was still dismissed upon consideration of all circumstances.

A hearing is required even if the employee does not answer the first written notice. “Hearing” for this purpose means any meaningful opportunity, verbal or written, given to the employee to answer the charges against him and submit evidence in support of his defense. A formal hearing or conference is no longer mandatory, except for the following cases:

a)	When requested by the employee in writing;
b)	When substantial evidentiary disputes exist;
c)	When a company rule or practice requires it; or
d)	When similar circumstances justify it. (Perez v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company, G.R. No. 152048, 7 April 2009)

There can be no dismissal on this ground if there is no such provision or no Collective Bargaining Agreement to begin with.

The requirement for membership in the collective bargaining agent does not apply in the following circumstances:

a)	When the employee is a bona fide member of a religion which does not permit its congregation members to be part of unions; (Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers Union, G.R. No. L-25246, 12 September 1974)
b)	When the employee was already a member of another union at the time of the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s signing; (Art. 259 (e), Labor Code) 
c)	When the Collective Bargaining Agreement expressly provides for exceptions; or
d)	When the employee was denied admission into the collective bargaining agent despite being qualified to be a member of the same. (Salunga v. Court of Industrial Relations, G.R. No. L-22456, 27 September 1967)

The employee’s dismissal must be requested by the collective bargaining agent. The employer cannot initiate the employee’s dismissal on its own based on the ground that he is not a member of the collective bargaining agent.

However, in these cases, the employer is required to pay the proper amount of separation pay to its terminated employees. 

For employees terminated due to closure that was not brought about by serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay must be at least 1 month pay or at least ½ month pay for every year of service – whichever is higher.
